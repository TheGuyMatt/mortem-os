# mortem-os
This is an OS development project that is being developed with the intention of learning more about OS development and low-level programming.
I was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaILnmUYS_U) by jdh.
I am still figuring out long term goals, but would either like to eventually develop and application for the OS and/or be able to develop 
mortem-os under the OS itself.

I am using the https://wiki.osdev.org resource to create this OS.
